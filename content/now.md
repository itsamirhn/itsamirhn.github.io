# What is this?

This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/) where I share what I'm currently doing in a nutshell.

# What I'm doing now?

Doing my master's degree in `Computer Security` @ VU Amsterdam.

Dealing with pwn challenges, CTFs, and binary exploitation 24/7.
Mostly I don't get time to do online CTFs, but I try to do them whenever I can (also looking for teammates).

In idea of creating some passive income opportunities for myself.
