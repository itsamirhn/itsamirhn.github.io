# Who am I?

My full name is `Seyed AmirMohammad Hosseini Nasab` and ... as you can see it's pretty long. So, I prefer to be use `Amir Hosseini` and called by `Amir`.
I'm originally from Tehran, Iran. I did my bachelor's degree in `Computer Science` back in there. After that, I'm doing my master's degree in `Computer Security` in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

# Me in one sentence

I'm that type of guy who loves to enter a finger into every tech pie.

# More?

I'm lazy to write more about myself. So, I'll just leave it here for now. Maybe I'll update it later. Who knows?!

# Cool people

I think these people are so cool (the one who inspired me and I have met them in real life):
