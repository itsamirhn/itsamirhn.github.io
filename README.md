# My Personal Website
This is the repository for my personal website. The website is hosted on GitHub Pages and is available at [amirhn.com](https://amirhn.com).

## Local Development
To run the website locally, you need to have [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) installed. After installing Zola, you can run the following command to start the development server:
```bash
zola serve
```
